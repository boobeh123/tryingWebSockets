/* 
I forgot a lot about the process of creating a project from scratch, 
as I started it the process, it starting coming back. 
These notes may help on initializing a project, but is not a how-to. 
It won't hold your hand, but provides (some) guidance

- Create git repo & Initial commit
- Create a package.json (npm init)
- Install dependencies (express)
- Create server.js
- Run server with command: 'node server.js'
- I forgot how to serve public files (css/js), so styling will be inline.
    - I did spend time to attempt it. It was taking time away from webSockets
- install more dependencies (socket.io)
