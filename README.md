The purpose of this project is to learn how to create real-time chat systems, and understand how to provide bi-directional communication channel between the a client & server.

My goal is to understand how to take the code from the documentation, optimize it for Express, and then add it into existing projects.

I will provide a link to the deployed project: (the moment I this system up & running)

The resources used to learn are from:
